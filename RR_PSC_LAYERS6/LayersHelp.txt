 1.  Layers Demo
     by  Robert Rayment
     5 Aug 2003

 2.  Basic Operation

   The basic operation is to load in a set of
   pictures and press the MERGE ALL button 
   whence the merged picture will show with
   the default transparency (alpha) set at
   50% for all pictures.  

   In the Merge Mode the individual pictures
   can be moved, their alpha varied, rotated,
   resized, deleted, effects applied and pairs
   of pictures swapped or merged.

   Note that the Thumb Bar must be visible to
   change the alpha or swap or merge pairs of
   pictures.
   
   The first picture loaded (pic 0) forms the
   background size, is always opaque and can
   be resized but not rotated.  To select
   other pictures click on a pic # button.
   
   To move, simply hold the left button down
   on a picture and move the mouse.  To change
   alpha, click a pic # button on the Thumb
   Bar, move the mouse over the alpha shade
   bar and left button to set value.

   When satisfied the picture can be saved by
   'Save Display' or 'Copy to clipboard" on the
   FILE menu.

   The speed of resizing and rotating is 
   governed by the speed of the computer. This
   can be controlled pressing [Set Loop Delay] 
   on the FILE menu.  Increase the number to
   slow down these operations.

 3.  Merge Mode ops

   Apart from those mentioned above the whole
   merged picture can be Clipped, Resized, 
   Draw on and have Effects without coming out
   of Merge Mode.  These operations on the
   whole merged picture, are transitory and 
   disappear if operations other than these 
   are carried out.  Therefore to keep the 
   image it needs to be saved or copied to the
   clipboard as mentioned above.  

 4.  Individual picture ops

   To show an individual picture a pic #
   button must be pressed on the Thumb Bar.
   This can then be Clipped, Lassoed, Resized, 
   Rotated, Deleted, Drawn on, have Effects, 
   Swapped or Merged with a previous picture.
   
   Individual pictures cannot be Lassoed,
   Clipped or Drawn on (but see TRACE) in 
   Merged Mode. 
   
   Press MERGE ALL to show the result.  
   Separate individual pictures can be saved
   by 'Save stored pic #' on the FILE menu.
   Note that if in Merged Mode SHOW ALL must 
   be pressed first to allow individual 
   pictures to be selected. Any picture on
   the clipboard can be loaded in as an 
   individual picture.

 5.  Drawing

   Drawing is toggled on/off by pressing the
   [Draw_OFF/ON] buttom on the top menu.
   This then shows a form with a description
   of the various drawing tools. If not in
   Merge Mode the drawing is added to the
   individual picture.  In Merge Mode with
   TRACE off,  the drawing is transitory and
   only shows on the merged display.  It needs
   to be saved to keep the picture.  See next 
   for Tracing.  Fill will not work on to a 
   transparent color in Merged Mode. 
   Cross hairs can be toggled on/off for the
   Drawing mode.
   
   Note that in Instructions LC means left
   click & RC right click the mouse buttons.

 6.  Tracing  [TRACE]

   Tracing can be turned on in Merge Mode
   whenever a set of pictures is loaded and a 
   valid pic number selected.  Then, drawing
   in Merge Mode will transfer that drawing to
   the rectangle of the selected picture 
   whenever the [Add Trace to pic #] on the 
   TRACE menu, or [ADD pic #] on the Draw 
   frame is pressed.
   Note that:- 
   Blending, Erase & Fill drawing is cannot
   be traced.
   Transparent areas cannot be Filled with 
   TRACE on.

 7.  Show All

   This shows all the pictures on the back-
   ground with no transparency.  It's use
   is to move the pictures around more
   quickly than in Merge Mode and to come
   out of Merge Mode for individual
   picture selection.

 8.  Transparent layers

   These layers can be loaded in at any point,
   from the FILE menu.  They are for your own 
   Drawings.  RGB(223,223,223) is the default 
   transparent color. These layers are named 
   TLayer 0, TLayer 1 etc. and this name can
   be erased with one of the Erase Drawing 
   Tools.  The TLayers color can be changed
   to a non-transparent one by Drawing with
   the Fill tool - but not in Merged Mode.
   For example if a solid color background
   is wanted, load a transparent layer first
   then resize and Fill color to whatever is
   required.
 
9.  Colors

   Draw & Text colors can be set from the
   standard Colors dialog.  In addition there
   is PicA Color where colors can be picked up
   from anywhere.  SHIFT to Set the DrawColor
   & CTRL key to Cancel.

   Note that the PicA Color tool doesn't always
   show when the program is first started -
   if this happens simply click for the tool
   again.

   The Draw color can also be selected from 
   the Drawing tools form.

10. Effects

   Effects function on individual pictures or
   on the whole display in Merge Mode. Noting
   that when the effects are on the whole of
   the Merge picture this is temporary and
   needs to be saved to keep them.
   See 3. above.

11. Text

   Pressing Text on the menu bar brings up a
   separate window on which text can be made.
   The Return button creates a new transparent
   layer with the text on it.  This can be
   left as a separate layer or merged with a
   previous picture (nb Swap to merge with
   other pictures).  

12. Undo

   Undo is limited. First, all loaded pictures
   have their filespec remembered and can be
   Re-loaded from the FILE menu.  There is
   always a preview of irreversible operations,
   allowing Accept or Cancel.  For Drawing
   there is also Redo which removes just the
   last drawn object.

13. ACTION

   The ACTION menu contains the same set of
   operations as on the Thumb Bar plus 
   recovering pictures that have been moved 
   outside the background and clearing 
   pictures.

14. Magnifier

   The [Magnifier] button toggles a magnifier
   on & off.  It can be moved around by 
   holding the left mouse button down on the
   magnifier display.  It is particularly 
   useful when using the Fill drawing tool
   for filling small areas since a black dot
   shows where the cursor hot spot is
   located.

15. Caviats

   At the moment the maximum number of pictues
   is set at the beginning of Form_Load, as is 
   the default setting for the loop delay, the
   a default transparent color and whether or
   not to show instructions ie

   MaxNumOfPics = 21  &
   TLIM = 200
   TransColor = RGB(223, 223, 223)
   TLayerWidth = 256
   TLayerHeight = 256
   aShowInstructions = True

   Later a preference file can be made for 
   these. TLIM can be changed from the FILE
   menu.

16. Included files

   The extra files needed are:
   
   Merge.bin
   FEffects.bin
   Rotate.bin
   LayersHelp.txt

   Again at some later point these could be 
   included in the RES file so that the EXE
   only requires the VB6 runtime module.
   There are no other dependencies.

17. Assembler files

   Along with the *.bin files above are the
   related assembler sources written for
   the NASM compiler.  The bin files are
   general enough to be used in other VB
   progs if wanted.  So there is a method
   for merging, anti-alias rotation and
   some effects.  

   There are lots of examples on PSC for 
   doing this.  Basically the *.bin files
   are loaded into a byte array and the 
   machine code, in them, accessed using
   the CallWindowProc API.  For each call
   a Type structure is used to send info to
   the machine code along with some info in
   the CallWindowProc parameters.
